# hcde-410-final
About:
The goal of this notebook is to show a realtionship between COVID-19 tagged tweets and a rise in COVID-19 cases in the area. I will show this by creating visual graphs and predictive machine learning model to demonstrate the hypothesized relationship between the two datasets. By analyzing tweets that express sentiment about COVID-19, we can gain insights into how individuals and communities are processing the pandemic, which may, in turn, predict or reflect trends in physical behavior.

Dataset Information
#1 Coronavirus tweets NLP - Text Classification by Aman Miglani on Kaggle
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification]
Coronavirus tweets NLP - Text Classification is a collection of Twitter tweets collected from the COVID-19 pandemic era using dates and keywords. The dataset was manually tagged with sentiment classifications. The dataset does not contain any identifiable Twitter IDs or names but the content of the tweet is available to view. This report does not use the text of the tweet, only the "TweetAt" and "sentiment" columns

#2 COVID-19 in USA Number of Novel Corona Virus 2019 cases in USA by SKR on Kaggle
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa?resource=download] shows all the COVID-19 new cases per day in each US county. We will utilize this dataset by grouping the county statistics by date for a total daily US case update. Data is obtained from The New York Times [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data] and The COVID Tracking Project[https://covidtracking.com/].
