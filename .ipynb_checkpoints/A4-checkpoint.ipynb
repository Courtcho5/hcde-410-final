    "For my final project I intend to explore how data scientists can create predictive models to predict infectious disease outbreaks. However, my approach will be to analyse tweets containing COVID-19 information and COVID-19 case information to potentially predict outbreaks. I am interested in working with this data set because sentiment analysis is tied to another research project I am developing. I am also interested in looking at how social media indicates disease outbreaks. From a human centered perspective, I could work on ways of making this interaction easier to understand, reducing the \"blackbox\" bubble surrounding lanaguage models. After I create the model, I will use human centered approaches to make it accessible. "

    "I have begun to research how to actually build a language mode, with my general understanding growing with each video I watch. However, I still have much to learn about. I am concerned that if I choose to do a mix of qualitative and quanitative data there may be issues in how my algorithm is able to process the data. I am not exactly sure how I will design a model to triangulate data and I am not sure if I would be able to resolve this with just google searching. I have tried to follow along some video tutorials and run into a huge error about 50% of the time. Another concern is not finding any matching columns between two datasets. But I think a potential solution could be to manually rename. "

    "For my final project I will explore the relationship between COVID-19 tweets and COVID-19 cases by country. My goal is to show a relationship between the tweets by day and the number of reported cases of COVID. Afterwards I will create a predictive LM model to predict whether particular negative or positive sentiment indicated a potential COVID-19 case surge. This model may be able to predict how sentiment online will impact public behaviour. Public sentiment could also be correlated with dates public health policies, such as lockdowns and mandates, are enacted. \n",

Lamsal et al. also uses a Granger Causality to determine if the predicted time series can forcast another.

A trendline can only tell you so much about how people feel, having an interactive model may be able to better mimic or reflect human sentiment. The goal is to be able to input a sentiment score and see how our past behavior in pandemics may influence future disease outbreaks."
