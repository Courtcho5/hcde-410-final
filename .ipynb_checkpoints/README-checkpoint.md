The goal of this notebook is to show a realtionship between COVID-19 tagged tweets and a rise in COVID-19 cases in the area. I will show this by creating visual graphs and predictive LM model to demonstrate the relationship between the two datasets. 
The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification is a database of tweets containing COVID-19 keywords. It also includes a sentiment analysis of each tweet. The dataset: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data shows all the COVID-19 new cases per day in each country. Combining these two datasets I will create a ML model using an applied mathematical model. The output of this model will be able to predict the COVID-19 cases for a inputed seniment score value. This notebook will also be annotated for reproducibility.
